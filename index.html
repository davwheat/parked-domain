      <h1>Parked on davw.network</h1>
      <p>
        This domain is parked, ready to be filled with glorious, insightful
        content!
      </p>

        <h2>What is this domain?</h2>
        <p>
          This domain is owned by David Wheatley, for one reason or another. I'm
          not currently using it for anything. Instead, I've just got it sat
          parked with this static HTML page. How boring!
        </p>

        <h2>I want to buy this domain!</h2>
        <p>
          It's pretty unlikely that I will sell any of my domains, but it's
          worth a try. Please get in touch by email:
